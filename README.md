This repository includes a Google Colab notebook template for an assignment focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multivariate probability topics related to covariance. The assignment provides insight into the application of Advanced Linear Algebra concepts, specifically Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, while exploring the use of covariance in determining relationships between features. The goal of PCA is to extract information while reducing the number of features from a dataset by identifying relevant principal components and transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while preserving as much information as possible.
